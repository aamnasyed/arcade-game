Game board
    create the rest of the divs(9 total)
    sections as rows
    event listener on cells ("click")
        event.target (where the event happened)
        console.log



 Game State
    who is the current player
    game board 
    the win conditions


TO DO list
step1. finish game board
    a. create sections and divs (give each cell an id=#) split divs into three different columns (creating three different children getElementsById)
    b. access the game board in javaScript through the dom (getElementsById)
    c. adding an event listener to the game board that listens for a click 
    d. use function in event listener to console.log the event.target 

step2. 
    cellClickFunction - call on event listener with a click 
    gameMoveFunction 
        a. it should grab the event.target.innertext (will check to see if the cell is empty- if it is empty you don't want to do anything)
        b. if cell is empty, we want to mark it with either an x or o - variable = currentPlayer (this helps us keep track of whose turn it is) 
        c. change the current player 

step3. 
    check win condition
